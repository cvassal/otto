- jquery for date inputs (format yyyy-MM-dd so far)
- query form (key values or json) for logs (+ distinct, order, count ?)
- logs pagination and events count
- allow spaces and some more chars in source name + create a valid db name + ensure that a name / db name is available when creating a source
- mongo shell (textarea)
- load sources config at startup and on change (for perf, not loading source when posting events), pre read aggregation conf...
- filter out default context.xml
- @Async post for remote api
- web page js api
- iso pattern for dates (1977-04-22T06:00:00Z) (http://fr.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO_8601)
- support for millis in event dates ?
- security
- authentication

- write user name in logs
- auth through ldap
- unit test for mongodb -> integration tests
- css

- thresholds and alerts
- mail reports
- batch add with random dates with custom range
- check that random generation generate on all the period
- nested properties in batch with json
- localize enums
- test selenium
- better format size parsing when creating a source (ex 100M 200K) - support for random spaces, lower case...
- docs
- configure log4j
- weird graph when no data
- be able to start otto on command line (java -jar otto.jar with main class in META-INF) (http://eclipsesource.com/blogs/2009/10/02/executable-wars-with-jetty/)
-> create a new module for otto-launcher-x.x.x.jar
